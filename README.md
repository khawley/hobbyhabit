# HobbyHabit
HobbyHabit is a hobby/task tracking application that lets users track their progress for any activity they want to hold themselves more accountable for. Users can set goals based on what they want to achieve, schedule text reminders, find events where they can socialize with others in their area interested in the same activities, and toggle between several data visualizations that make analyzing the details of their progress easy and approachable, so that marveling at their hard work is a snap and they can get back to getting things done!
